# Go To-Do Web Application

This is a simple To-Do list web application written in Go. It uses the `net/http` package to serve HTTP requests.

The application allows users to:

* View a list of to-do items.
    
* Add new items to the list.
    
* Delete items from the list.
    

All data is stored in memory and will be reset when the application restarts.
